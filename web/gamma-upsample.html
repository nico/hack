<h1>Gamma-correct image upsampling</h1>

<p>
<strong>WARNING:</strong> This page will only look right on a screen with a 2x scale factor, such as
on all recent Macs.

<h2>Source image</h2>
<p>
Here's an image (credit: Jonas Berlin, <a href="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/gamma.html#:~:text=Jonas%20Berlin%20sent%20this%20image">source</a>).


<details>
<summary>(It uses a hack to force it to be displayed at 1:1 pixel scale.)</summary>

<p>
It's displayed by using the same image file for both the <code>1x</code> and
<code>2x</code> variants, like so:

<p>
<code>
<pre>
&lt;img srcset="gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png 1x, gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png 2x"
     src="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png" /&gt;
</pre>
</code>

<p>
(That's not how <code>srcset</code> is supposed to be used! Normally, you'd use
an image of twice the resolution for the <code>2x</code> image. We use it as a
hack here to make sure that browsers don't scale up the image on retina
screens.)

</details>

<p>
<img srcset="gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png 1x, gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png 2x"
     src="gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png" />

<h2>Gamma-correct upsampled image</h2>
<p>
Here's the same image scaled up 2x, using software that does gamma-correct
image upsampling. It also uses the hack mentioned above to show it at 1x zoom on
retina screens:

<p>
<img srcset="gamma-1.0-or-2.2-2x.png 1x, gamma-1.0-or-2.2-2x.png 2x"
     src="gamma-1.0-or-2.2-2x.png" />

<details>
<summary>How I made the gamma-correctly upsampled image</summary>

<p>
I used <a href="https://entropymine.com/imageworsener/">imageworsener</a>,
with this command:

<p>
<code>
<pre>
./imagew -filter triangle -w 1024 -h 512 gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png out.png
</pre>
</code>

<p>
This tells imageworsener to use a bilinear filter. It uses gamma-correct
resampling by default. If you also pass <code>-nogamma</code>, you will get
the behavior that browsers currently get you, see below.
</details>

<h2>How your browser upsamples it</h2>
<p>
Here's the image how your browser displays it when just using
<code>&lt;img src="gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png" /&gt;</code> (i.e. how it
displays most images on the web):

<p>
<img src="gamma-1.0-or-2.2.png" />

<h1>Do browsers get this right?</h1>
<p>
At the time of this writing (Oct 2025), none of the major browsers does
gamma-correct image resizing when upsampling images -- despite that being
how the majority of the images on the web are displayed.

<h1>Effect on dithering demos</h1>

<p>
This is why articles about dithering that bother to deal with gamma
correction tend to include a disclaimer along the lines "trust me, this
is really better, even though it looks worse in your browser": The browser
gamma-incorrectly upsamples the source and dithered images, and if you do
gamma-incorecct dithering, the errors cancel out!

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
A while ago, Eric Brasseur did a 
<a href="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/gamma.html">detailed write-up
on gamma-correct image sampling</a>. It explains what gamma-correct image
resampling is. It focused on downsampling. It looks like all browsers fixed
their downsampling in response, but upsampling still has the same problem.
